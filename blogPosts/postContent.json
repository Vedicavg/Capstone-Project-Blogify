    "PostContent": "Blog, online journal where an individual, group, or corporation presents a record of activities, thoughts, or beliefs. Some blogs operate mainly as news filters, collecting various online sources and adding short comments and Internet links. Other blogs concentrate on presenting original material. In addition, many blogs provide a forum to allow visitors to leave comments and interact with the publisher. “To blog” is the act of composing material for a blog. Materials are largely written, but pictures, audio, and videos are important elements of many blogs. The “blogosphere” is the online universe of blogs.The World Wide Web and the idea of a blog appeared at the same time. Tim Berners-Lee, often described as the Web’s inventor, created the first “blog” in 1992 to outline and render visible the ongoing development of the Web and the software necessary to navigate this new space. Web history, especially the early growth of Web servers and sites, is chronicled on the various “What’s New” pages in the archives of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Another example of a blog that existed before the word was coined is Slashdot. Following its debut in September 1997, Slashdot operated as a clearinghouse for information in its “News for Nerds,” with a small set of editors who decided what to publish of numerous articles and news items submitted by the “geek” community. Indeed, Web sites mentioned on Slashdot were often overwhelmed, leading to a condition now known as being “slashdotted.”\r\n\r\nIn December 1997, Jorn Barger, an early online presence, coined the term web log to describe his Web site RobotWisdom.com. In early 1999 another individual with considerable online experience, Peter Merholz, began to employ the term blog on his site Peterme.com. While the history of the term is pretty well settled, the same cannot be said of the identity of the first blogger. Depending on the definition of a blog, Berners-Lee may not qualify as the first blogger. Claimants to this title include Justin Hall, a college student who started an online list at links.net in 1994; Carolyn Burke, who began publishing Carolyn’s Diary online in 1995; and Dave Winer, who has published Scripting News online since April 1, 1997.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the blogosphere has been nothing short of remarkable. Technorati, Inc., a Web site and organization dedicated to mapping and searching the blogosphere, found that by October 2005 there were 19.6 million blogs, a number that has been doubling roughly every five months. Approximately 70,000 new blogs are created each day—or, more vividly, nearly one every second. Also of importance is the growth of blogs in languages other than English, especially Chinese.\r\n\r\nDespite the overwhelming number of blogs, very few individuals make a living as a blogger. A few individuals earn money from their Web sites by carrying ads and appeals for funds, and some blogs are financed by corporate or organizational owners; nevertheless, most bloggers derive nonmonetary rewards from their activity. In particular, blogs offer ordinary individuals the ultimate soapbox and an opportunity to create their own digital identity or personal brand.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the proliferation of blogs is the ease with which they can be established and maintained. Many services and software systems are available that allow an individual to set up a blog in less than an hour. Of course, updating a blog is essential for maintaining its presence and importance. Statistics on blogs that are started but not updated remain elusive, but the proportion is undoubtedly substantial.netiquette\r\nsocial behaviour\r\n    \r\nAlso known as: Internet etiquette, network etiquette\r\nWritten by \r\nFact-checked by \r\nArticle History\r\nAbbreviation of: Internet etiquette or network etiquette\r\nRelated Topics: Internet social network etiquette social media\r\nNetiquette, guidelines for courteous communication in the online environment. It includes proper manners for sending e-mail, conversing online, and so on. Much like traditional etiquette, which provides rules of conduct in social situations, the purpose of netiquette is to help construct and maintain a pleasant, comfortable, and efficient environment for online communication, as well as to avoid placing strain on the system and generating conflict among users.\r\n\r\nNetiquette includes rules that provide guidance for appropriate social interaction and technical performance online. What constitutes good netiquette varies among the many subcultures of the Internet, and, of course, netiquette issues change with time and technology. Nevertheless, some general principles of proper online manners can be outlined. They include:\r\n\r\nLurking. Lurking means that one reads the posts of a group without participating in the conversation—that is, one assumes the role of a silent reader/observer. Proper netiquette requires some knowledge of the culture of a group in which one chooses to participate; therefore, preliminary knowledge of the group, gained from lurking, is beneficial.\r\nReading the FAQs. FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions; FAQs also provide answers to these questions. A FAQ is a list of questions that are commonly asked among newcomers. Reading a FAQ before posting helps a new group member to avoid committing the faux pas of asking questions that have already been answered, an act that often generates negative responses from other users.\r\nRemember the Human. Communicating via computers tends to lead people to lose sight of the feelings of, or to be insensitive to, others; consequently, users tend to be more blunt in stating their views than they probably would be face-to-face. Users need to be reminded that although they are communicating online, they are nevertheless dealing with real people who have real emotions.\r\nAvoid Flames. A flame is a message that contains strong personal criticism or attack. Users are advised not to engage in flaming or participate in flame wars. One should treat others the same way that one would like to be treated, and profanity is not good netiquette. A rational tone and a polite manner are preferred.\r\nAvoid Shouting. Typing in ALL UPPER CASE is considered shouting, which is not good netiquette. To emphasize a point, instead of typing in all upper case, one can use _underlining_ or *asterisks* around the text needing emphasis.\r\nNot a Homework Center. Online groups are resourceful arenas; however, users should not use groups as a first resort for information-gathering or as a “quick” source for homework or class assignments. Before going online to ask questions, users should have completed preliminary research by visiting the library or doing a Web search.\r\nComposition Protocols. Users should observe correct grammar and be careful about punctuation and spelling when composing their messages. Online messages should be clear, concise, and organized; an articulate and thoughtful message generates more responses.",

    "PostContent": "So life is nothing but just a series of incidents which lead to experiences, and these experiences are what gives rise to stories. These stories teach us many things, and these things are remembered by all the human beings for many years...<3\r\n\r\nOne important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life.\r\n\r\nMany people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans.\r\n\r\nProbably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one’s death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.",

    "PostContent": "Nature refers to the physical world and all forms of life species on earth in general. Our natural ecosystem is the community of biotic and abiotic components. The biotic components are the living organisms that also include humans. Abiotic components are the non-living components such as air, water, minerals and soil. The biotic and abiotic components are interrelated and interact with each other through energy flow.\r\n\r\nNatural ecosystem also includes the interrelation between diverse organisms and their environment. Natural ecosystem obtains energy primarily from sun through photosynthesis. Through the process of photosynthesis plants obtain energy from sunlight and absorb carbon dioxide from atmosphere. Plants combine carbon dioxide and water to produce oxygen and carbohydrates. The energy obtained by plants is consumed by animals. Animals also play important role in nutrient cycle and flow of energy. They influence plants and other micro-organisms in the ecosystem. Thus the energy enters ecosystem through the process of photosynthesis and is transferred to the living organisms. Thus, natural ecosystem supports life on earth.\r\n\r\n",
